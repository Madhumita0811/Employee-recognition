<!-- How It Works:
Employee Profile Management: The user fills out a form to create an employee profile, including name, department, job title, and skills.
Skill Matrix: The profiles are displayed in a simple grid, showing the employee’s details and skills. Each skill is displayed as a tag.
Local Storage: All data is stored in the browser’s local storage, so it persists across sessions.
Remove Profile: Users can remove a profile by clicking the "Remove"
 button, which deletes it from the local storage and updates the display.
 Employee Profile Management:

Profile Creation: Employees can enter their basic information, job title, department, and add skills using input fields.
Skill Tags: Employees can select skills from a predefined list or add custom skills, along with a proficiency level (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Expert).
Certifications and Achievements: Users can list certifications or achievements in a text area.
Skill Matrix Dashboard:

Skill Heatmap: Display a simple grid or list showing skills and their levels. Use color-coding (e.g., green for experts, yellow for intermediates) to visually distinguish proficiency levels.
Skill Gaps: Highlight skills that are marked as "Needs Improvement" or have low proficiency levels.
Search and Filter: Allow users to search for specific skills or filter the list based on proficiency level or department.
Development Plans:

Training Programs: Create a list of training programs that employees can select from. These could be hardcoded or dynamically added via the interface.
Progress Tracking: Employees can mark training programs as "In Progress" or "Completed."
Goal Setting: Employees can set development goals using input fields, which are then saved and displayed on their profiles.
Feedback and Endorsements:

Peer Feedback: Users can add comments or notes about their skills or receive feedback from a predefined list of suggestions.
Skill Endorsements: Allow employees to endorse each other by selecting a skill and adding an endorsement note.
Analytics and Reporting:

Skill Development Reports: Generate simple charts using a library like Chart.js or plain CSS for visualizing skill levels or training progress.
Trend Analysis: Use local storage to track changes over time and display basic trends in skill improvement.
Employee Recognition:

Top Performers: Highlight employees who have achieved the most significant skill development or completed the most training programs.
Certificates and Badges: Award digital badges that are visually represented on the employee profile page. -->
